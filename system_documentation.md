## Technical Overview:
The User Management System is built using the FastAPI web framework, which is known for its high performance, ease of use, and automatic API documentation generation. The project follows a modular and layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability.

The core components of the architecture include:

- FastAPI Application: The main entry point of the application, handling API requests and responses.
- Database Layer: Utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient database interactions and data persistence.
- Alembic for database migrations
- Service Layer: Contains the business logic and core functionalities of the application.
- API Layer: Defines the API endpoints, request validation, and response serialization.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implements OAuth2 with Password Flow for secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- Email Service: Handles email notifications and verification, with support for email templates.

The project adheres to best practices and coding standards, including:

- PEP 8 style guide for consistent code formatting
- Type hints for improved code clarity and maintainability
- Dependency injection for loose coupling and testability
- Asynchronous programming for efficient handling of concurrent requests
- Error handling and logging for robustness and debugging
- Testing with pytest for unit tests and integration tests
- Containerization with Docker for seamless deployment and scalability

## Key Features and Implementation:

### User Management:
- User registration and login functionality - Implemented - needs more testing
- User roles and permissions: Admin, Manager, Authenticated, Anonymous  - implemented needs more testing
- User account management (BREAD) 
- Email verification for user accounts that register
- First user is automaticaly admin, but in the future this needs to be turned into a command line program.  Its not secure to do this but for development and testing its fine for now.

### API Design and Documentation:
- RESTful API endpoints for user management
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API exploration and integration (Automatically generated by FastAPI) http://localhost/docs 
- Secure authentication and authorization using OAuth2 with Password Flow

### Database Integration:
- Integration with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM (Refer to `database.py` and `user_model.py`)
- Efficient and scalable database design for user management
- Asynchronous database operations for improved performance (Refer to `user_service.py`)

### Email Notifications:
- Email templates for user verification and other notifications (Refer to `email_service.py` and templates directory)
- Integration with Mailtrap for email testing and viewing in a test account (Refer to `config.py` for Mailtrap settings)
- Easily customizable email templates with headers and footers (Refer to email templates in the templates directory)

### Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Comprehensive test suite for unit testing and integration testing (Refer to `test_database_operations.py`, `test_users.py`, and other test files)
- Fixtures for setting up test data and mocking dependencies (Refer to `conftest.py`)
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with GitHub Actions (Refer to `.github/workflows/main.yml`)

### Deployment and Containerization:
- Dockerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability (Refer to `Dockerfile`)
- Docker Compose for managing multi-container setup (Refer to `docker-compose.yml`)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment (Refer to `.github/workflows/main.yml`)

### Administrator User Creation:
The project includes a mechanism to automatically assign the administrator role to the first user created in the system. When the user table is empty, the first user who registers will be granted the administrator role. This ensures that there is at least one user with administrative privileges to manage the system. (Refer to `user_service.py create method` for the implementation)

### CORS
The application has basic CORS support allthough it isn't configured for a specific domain. See the main.py file in app.
