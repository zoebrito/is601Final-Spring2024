# 🚀 User Management System - Technical Overview

Welcome to the User Management System, a powerful and scalable solution built using the FastAPI web framework! 🌟 This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, key features, and implementation details. Let's dive in and explore the awesomeness! 😎

## 🏗️ Architecture

The User Management System follows a modular and layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and promote maintainability and scalability. The core components include:

- **FastAPI Application**: The main entry point of the application, handling API requests and responses.
- **Database Layer**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient database interactions and data persistence.
- **Alembic**: Used for seamless database migrations.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and core functionalities of the application.
- **API Layer**: Defines the API endpoints, request validation, and response serialization.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements OAuth2 with Password Flow for secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Email Service**: Handles email notifications and verification, with support for email templates.

## 💪 Best Practices and Standards

The project adheres to industry best practices and coding standards to ensure code quality, clarity, and maintainability:

- **PEP 8**: Consistent code formatting for improved readability.
- **Type Hints**: Enhances code clarity and catches potential type-related issues.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling and testability.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Robust error handling and debugging capabilities.
- **Testing with Pytest**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Seamless deployment and scalability.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 👥 User Management

- ✅ User registration and login functionality (needs more testing)
- 🔑 User roles and permissions: Admin, Manager, Authenticated, Anonymous (needs more testing)
- 🍞 User account management (BREAD operations)
- 📧 Email verification for registered user accounts
- 🔒 First user automatically becomes admin (to be converted to a command-line program in the future)

### 📜 API Design and Documentation

- 🌐 RESTful API endpoints for user management
- 📝 Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API exploration and integration
- 🔐 Secure authentication and authorization using OAuth2 with Password Flow

### 🗄️ Database Integration

- 🐘 Integration with PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM
- ⚡ Efficient and scalable database design for user management
- ⏩ Asynchronous database operations for improved performance

### 📧 Email Notifications

- 📬 Email templates for user verification and other notifications
- 🎨 Easily customizable email templates with headers and footers
- 🔍 Integration with Mailtrap for email testing and viewing in a test account

### 🧪 Testing and Quality Assurance

- 🔍 Comprehensive test suite for unit testing and integration testing
- 🔧 Fixtures for setting up test data and mocking dependencies
- 🚀 Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with GitHub Actions

### 🚀 Deployment and Containerization

- 🐳 Dockerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability
- 📦 Docker Compose for managing multi-container setup
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment

### 🔐 Administrator User Creation

- 🔑 Automatic assignment of administrator role to the first user created in the system
- ⚠️ Implemented for development and testing purposes, to be converted to a command-line program for security

### 🌐 CORS Support

- 🔀 Basic CORS support, although not configured for a specific domain

## 🆕 Features to be developed and tested

### 🆔 Username Generation (needs more testing)

- 🔀 Users are assigned a random username upon creation
- 🌐 Username is generated based on a combination of nouns, verbs, and a number
- ✏️ Users can change their username, but it must be unique
- 🔍 Username serves as a URL-safe identifier for posts and public information
- 🔒 Ensures user anonymity and privacy, if desired
- ⚠️ Needs more testing and verification

### 🌟 Pro Status Upgrade (needs additional development pro status is added to the schema and has some functionality)

- 🆙 Users can request to upgrade to pro status
- 📝 Users must fill out their complete profile to be verified as a pro
- 🔍 Pro status will be used for various purposes in the future
- 🔐 Upgrade request and verification process needs to be implemented
